The main story revolves around the Project at Eden's Gate, a doomsday cult that rules the land under the guise of its charismatic leader, Joseph Seed. Players control an unnamed junior deputy sheriff who becomes trapped in Hope County, and must work alongside factions of a resistance to liberate the county from the despotic rule of the Seeds and Eden's Gate. Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration; players battle enemy soldiers and dangerous wildlife using a wide array of weapons. The game features many elements found in role-playing games, such as a branching storyline and side quests. The game also features a map editor, a co-operative multiplayer mode, and a competitive multiplayer mode.",

         "cheats": "Levitate With DIY Flying Machines: Reddit User Hot_Diggity_Damn discovered that while Magnesis does not work if you are standing on an object, a glitch allows you use the Magnesis Rune while in or on a mine cart. In order to levitate the object, place either another mine cart or metal box in the bottom mine cart, and use Magnesis on the lower object to lift the entire apparatus into the air. This can be incredibly tricky - and one wrong move can send the whole thing crashing down. You'll need to center the levitating mine cart as quickly as possible, which may require rotating continuously. Note that you can increase speed by pushing the D-Pad up - but do so carefully as it may cause the platform to tilt wildly. Mine carts can be found in the Goron City region and respawn regularly both above and below the shrine at the edge of town - but can despawn. Metal boxes can also be found nearby down the slopes from the city - or can be summoned using a Guardian amiibo. Note that the incomplete E3 version of the game let users levitate on single metal objects. Nintendo changed/fixed that behavior for the final release. You can pack extra meals with stamina boosting effects to glide from Death Mountain to Satori Mountains, which in that experience captures Hyrule in a highers altitude point of view. Prepare cold resistant clothing as well or elixirs.

Exactly who this is is never revealed in the game, though it is heavily implied to be Navi, his fairy companion from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998) (Ocarina of Time). This was later confirmed by the makers in 'Hyrule Historia', the official Legend of Zelda encyclopedia. In the unofficial manga of Ocarina of Time, it is suggested at the end that Navi left because she had feelings for Link, but knew that he would never return those feelings. Although the manga is non-canon, series creator Shigeru Miyamoto has confirmed that Navi is in love with Link, but she is jealous of Zelda, hinting that this may have been the reason of her leaving.",
         "cheats": "Song of Double Time and Warped time: These two songs are often missed by those who don't hear everything the Scarecrow has to say. When talking with him either in the Astral Observatory or the General Store, he will mention that he knows of a special song that when played in reverse, can slow down time, and when played by repeating every note twice, fast forwards time. This special song is none other than the Song of Time. To play the Song of Warped Time, simply play the Song of Time backwards. This will slow down time considerably, allowing you to get more things done per 3-day cycle, and you will find that people in Clock Town, the UFO's at Romani Ranch, and others will all move slower. To play the Song of Double Time, play only the first three notes from the Song of Time, but play each note twice in a row. In the 3DS version of the game, you can fast forward time by the hour, all the way to the next day. In previous verisons, playing the song will forward you to the next night or dawn, depending on what time you play the song. Owl Statue Warp Glitch: There is a glitch that allows the player to warp to any owl statues in the game. As you may already know, playing the Song of Soaring sends the player to the Great Bay Coast statue by default, if no remote owls have previously been activated. However, the default location can be changed. To perform the glitch, start by hovering over a point on the map in your Pause menu. For example, you might choose Deku Palace. From there, immediately unpause and play the Song of Soaring. The position of the cursor on the map that appears should indicate Mountain Village as the destination. This is a functional warp. You can continue to use the glitch to reach other areas as your selection of destinations quickly increases without any need to actually explore. The list of places you can highlight on the map to arrive at a new owl statue is as follows:, Great Bay leads to Great Bay Coast, Zora Hall leads to Zora Cape, Romani Ranch leads to Snowhead, Deku Palace leads to Mountain Village, Woodfall leads to Clock Town, Clock Town leads to Milk Road, Snowhead leads to Woodfall, Ikana Graveyard leads to Southern Swamp, Goron Village leads to Stone Tower, Stone Tower leads to Dungeon Entrance. Note that the last of those options is currently not useful, as it will soft lock your game. The same is true of the 'R' and 'Z' button prompts on the map screen. Use of this glitch allows you to skip large portions of the game.",
         "easter_eggs": "Bomb Shop's Moon Expedition: In the original version of Majora's Mask, you could find a note in the corner of the Bomb Shop about a planned moon expedition using, of course, bombs. In the 3DS Version of the game, more has been added in the form of several sketches of this planned flight that shows the rocket ship flying into space, landing on the moon, and finding a chest! Ikana's Paper Airplane: On the top floor of Ikana Castle are several large pillars, some of which you can jump to for switches and Heart Pieces. One of these pillars has a tiny curious airplane, and can be seen in both versions of the game."},

Also, the musical chant that can be heard in the Fire Temple in the original Nintendo 64 version of the game was removed in later versions because it included an Islamic call to prayer. The developers had obtained the sample from a commercially available sound library, without realizing that playing music over an Islamic call to prayer is considered offensive to Muslims; however, they had already removed the chant before it caused major controversy, because it was policy at the time not to make any religious references in Nintendo games.

Of all the big Marvel characters, one of the most important figures bears the initials T.S. - Tony Stark. We don't get to see Tony or Iron Man and the other Avengers during the game, so it's interesting to think if this \"job\" is more for Peter, or for Spider-Man. The other big note here may be just as important - it reads, \"RR suit fabric ballistic? Call to confirm\". Again, of all the Marvel characters out there, the most important figure with those initials is none other than Reed Richards, also known as Mr. Fantastic - super scientist and founder of the Fantastic Four, which has rarely intertwined with the rest of the Marvel universe in movies or games. It's possible that this note may tease the inclusion of the Fantastic Four character in the next game, or hopefully at the very least some more direct references."},

In fact this \"Gauntlet\" is powered by six specific \"gems\" that take the form of six Epic Enchantments found all over the game - which may sound pretty familiar to Marvel's Infinity Gauntlet and the Infinity Stones. There are analogs for all six Infinity stones, and they can all be found in different ways: Andvari's Soul (aka the Soul Stone) is a quest reward from Brok's first quest: Second Hand Soul. Eye of the Outer Realm (aka the Space Stone) can be found in a chest after you [[Escape From Helheim in the story, and check out a back room in Odin's Hidden Chamber on the upper floor of Tyr's Temple. Muspelheim's Eye of Power (aka the Power Stone) can be crafted from Brok and Sindri, but only once you have gained the resources needed by taking on the various challenges in Muspelheim. Ivaldi's Corrupted Mind (aka the Mind Stone) is found from defeating Olrun the Valkyrie - located in the realm of Alfheim. Asgard's Stone of Existence (aka the Reality Stone) is found from defeating Rota the Valkyrie - who is located in Helheim. Njord's Temporal Stone (aka the Time Stone) is the last stone that can be obtained by defeating the Valkyrie Queen Sigrun once you have defeated all other Valkyries and return to the Council of Valkyries. On it’s own, the talisman attack is pretty handy, and it’s improved by adding one of the six stones, but when you upgrade it to the max and fill all three with any of these “Infinity Stones,” you really see a big improvement. Not only do you get the knockback shockwave, the gauntlet will also fire off two clusters of projectiles - they do pretty decent damage and can knock enemies into walls to add a bunch to their stun meter. The blasts can also be directed by where you face the camera, and the coolest thing is that if they don’t all detonate on an enemy or by striking a surface, they’ll boomerang back to finish the job."},

A few Fighters that wall jump can actually remain stuck to a wall a brief time: (Sheik, Squirtle, Diddy Kong, Lucario, Greninja, Bayonetta) Using the same attack constantly will decrease its power. This is called stale moves. Use variety! Dodging too many times in a row makes each dodge less effective. You can grab an item in midair by dodging or attacking at the right moment.

You can break your fall when hitting the wall, floor, ceiling after being launched by hitting the shield button. Tapping the shield button will spring your character upright, while tapping shield + a direction will initiate a dodge-roll. Tapping the Jump + Attack button will initiate an automatic \"Shorthop\" attack, letting you perform aerial attacks low to the ground. If you are behind in the match, you can sometimes spawn with a Final Smash ready to use. If you turn around while running and grab, your grab range will be longer.

Your score is determined by the amount of KOs you've dealt, minus the amount of times you've been KO'd or fallen. Different stages call for different tactics, but they all revolve around racking up damage and getting knocked away. If you are knocked away, you have a double jump and something called a Recovery move, a special move that gives you one last chance at getting back onto the stage.

There are genuinely new characters as well as clones. Clones usually share the same moves and attacks as one of the main characters with some subtle adjustments. Apparently there are several ways of unlocking characters either via Vs. matches or single-player mode. Once the conditions are met, the secret character will appear and challenge you to a battle. Win the battle, and you get the character. Here's the ways to do it: Jigglypuff -- Clear Adventure or Classic mode with any character or play Vs. more than 50 times. Luigi -- Luigi's appearance depends entirely on your level time for the first Adventure mode level. The time stops the moment you jump the \"flag\" finish line at the end of the Mushroom Kingdom sidescrolling level. Look at your seconds counter and try to time it so that you get a \"2\" (as in Luigi, the \#2 Mario Brother) in your seconds (Only the 2nd seconds collum like 32, 52, 12, etc). If you got it right, you will see Luigi appear over Princess Peach's Castle in Adventure mode during a cut-scene. Complete the Adventure and he will appear after the credits. Or: Play Vs. Mode more than 800 times. Young Link (Clone of Link) -- Clear Classic or Adventure mode with 10 characters (two of which have to be Link and Zelda/Sheik) or complete 500 Vs. matches. Dr. Mario (Clone of Mario) -- Clear Classic or Adventure mode with Mario without using continues (Tip: use Very Easy difficulty) or play more than 100 Vs. matches. Ganondorf (Clone of Captain Falcon) -- Clear Event Match 29 or play more than 600 Vs. matches. Pichu -- Clear 200 Vs. Matches, clear Event Match 37, or conquer Classic mode with Mewtwo. Marth -- Use the original 14 characters at least once in Vs. or another regular mode by either clearing it or encountering a Game Over, or play more than 400 Vs. matches. Roy (Clone of Marth) -- Clear Classic Mode with Marth without using a continue or play more than 900 Vs. matches. Falco (Clone of Fox) -- Clear 300 Vs. Matches or beat the 100-Man Melee. Mewtwo -- Rack up 20:00 hours in Combined Vs. Play Time or play 700 Vs. matches. Mr. Game & Watch -- Clear Target Test, Classic, or Adventure mode with all 24 characters.

As such, players can perform various techniques taken from the Pokémon series, such as special moves and Mega Evolutions (which can be built up from attacks using a \"Synergy Gauge\").[7] Players can also use Support Pokémon to give them special benefits such as buffs in attack or defense.

Once you collect the weapon, simply make your way back to a campfire and perform a save while you still have some ammo left. Reload the save to refill your ammo. Ravagers, Thunderjaws and other large beasts will all succumb rather easily to these heavy weapons, which makes this exploit great for grinding for XP and leveling up quickly. Become Invincible with Hidden Armor: There is a hidden armor called \"Shield-Weaver\", which renders Aloy (almost) invincible. The armor contains a rechargeable shield that absorbs all incoming damage, including falling damage. If the shield is close to failing, it will blink red and emit a high-pitched alarm sound.

The trophies are expensive, ranging from 50,000G to 200,000G. If you did want to buy them all, and don't have enough money to do so, then you can back your save up to the cloud or a USB stick.

This method only works efficiently if you are already between Level 55-70 in your game. If you face and enemy that is Level 80 while at a low level, you will do almost no damage to it through hacking. Its highly advised that you fill all of your plug in chips with EXP leveling to make this faster. You can buy the +3 ones from Emil. Step 1 - Go to the Amusement Park during 9S's story. If you have advanced too far, or are in your third playthrough, you'll need to complete that to get chapter select. This method is intended for end game purposes to fight the super bosses such as Truck Emil and the True Emil's. Step 2 - Hack the larger robot in the square, and use him to kill the other robots in the area. You can only control a robot if he is friendly, if he's hostile he'll just explode. Step 3 - Once all the robots are dead (you need them dead else you cant lock onto the golden robot in the middle), lock onto the middle robot and then hack it. You'll get a ton of XP for hacking and then even more when killing him. You will one hit kill him around level 70 through hacking. Step 4 - Go to the transporter, and save your game. Now, quit to the main menu and continue. All the enemies will have respawned and you can keep doing this to level up. Typically, you go up 3-4 levels around level 80.",

However, Prince Lothric, the chosen linker for this age, has abandoned his duty and instead chooses to watch the flame die from afar. The bell is the last hope for the Age of Fire, resurrecting previous Lords of Cinder (heroes who linked the flame in past ages) to attempt to link the fire again; however, all but one Lord shirk their duty.",

It can be tricky to pull off - here's the steps you'll need to take: Step 1 - Head to New Donky City and go to the main plaza near the jump rope area where Talkatoo is. Step 2 - Jump and throw Cappy over Talkatoo's head so that it will come back and hit him, and talk to Talkatoo right before Cappy smacks into the bird. This can take a lot of practice - but if done right, the camera will lock into place until you warp somewhere else, and Talkatoo can't be talked to again. However, we don't want to lock the camera just yet. Step 3 - Once you have gotten the hang of the timing, once you speak to Talkatoo before Cappy hits him, hold ZR or ZL and immediately roll away from Talkatoo. This will hold the camera from glitching UNTIL you have Talkatoo in the screen again, at which point the camera will stop moving. We're almost there. Step 4 - With this method, roll away from Talkatoo, then run towards the jump rope area and perform a ground pound as the camera pans over to load in Talkatoo. If done correctly, Mario will freeze standing in midair near the jump rope. You'll need to position yourself near enough to the jump rope that it will start counting you as jumping - even though you are frozen in place, and no jumping will be needed. Now you can sit back and get the highest score you want! (note that it will take a LONG time to reach the max number - about 15 hours total).",

Rumor has it that Rare came up with a way that lets you pull out BK while your N64 is still on and quickly plug in Banjo-Tooie. However, rumors from within Nintendo also suggest that the Big \"N\" wasn't thrilled at all about this technical feat and wanted Rare to get rid of the feature. Whatever the truth is, we still don't know how BK and BT connect. Until we find out, you can at least collect all the hidden goodies to get ready for the big day. Go to Banjo-Kazooie's Sandcastle in Treasure Trove Cove and start off by spelling CHEAT. Every letter you hit will make a \"moo\" sound to confirm that you did it correctly. After you spelled CHEAT, you will be able to enter the following lengthy cheats to unlock the hidden stuff. The cheats are pretty much self-explanatory. Note that the letters won't make any noise.",

         "description": "Fortnite: Save the World is designed as player-versus-environment game, with four players cooperating towards a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like \"husks\". The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that help to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes. Fortnite Battle Royale is a player-versus-player battle royale game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players airdrop from a \"Battle Bus\" that crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and attack other players, eliminating them. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming storm; players outside that safe area take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner. Fortnite Creative is a sandbox game mode where players are given complete freedom to create anything they want on an island, such as battle arenas, race courses, platforming challenges and more. Epic Games plans to review some of the most popular creations from Creative and rotate these into the Battle Royale map in an area called \"The Block\".",
