# Noob News

Internet Technology final project

## Overview

As of right now there is no “one stop shop” for game information driven completely by video game players. This would also benefit video game developers as they would be able to gain valuable feedback from the video game players themselves.

That’s where Noob News comes into play, going from Noob to Expert in no time.

## How-To

To run the application, please do the following:

0. Create a new environment, e.g. `conda create -n noobnews python=3.7.1`, and activate the noobnews environment.

1. Clone this repository in your workspace.

2. Install requirements.txt, e.g. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
